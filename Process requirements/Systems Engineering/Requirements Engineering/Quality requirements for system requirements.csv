- Singular is too ambiguous, has multiple interpretations
- Self-contained is about no outside references
- Independent same as self-contained
- Decomposed would be a property of a requirements specification

Connections:
- Requirements count may be used to report implementation progress
- Requirements count may be used to estimate implementation efforts
- Requirements are improved through feedback
- Requirements are used to validate the system

Impact:
- Non-atomic requirements still make a complete requirements specification possible, but make implementation planning and implementation status reporting unreliable.","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","yes","no","no"
