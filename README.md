# ProST: Processes for Systems Thinking

ProST is a open-source, collaborative, modeled process standard for systems thinking.
Systems thinking entails processes for systems engineering, design thinking, and mission alignment.
## Systems thinking
Systems thinking is to think of everything as a system, part of a system, made up of systems.
This opens three questions:
- What kind of system am I? -> Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic
- What is my environment?
- What are my systems? -> Artifacts, Processes, People

### Types of systems

### Mission alignment
How to we organize our efforts to best achieve our mission?
- Agile methodologies
- Waterfall development

### Design Thinking
How do we make sure we have the right design?
- Problem space
- Solution space

### Systems Engineering
How do we model the system?
- V-Model
